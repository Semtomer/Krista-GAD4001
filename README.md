PROJECT DETAILS

Game Title: Krista  
Genre: Third-Person Action, Tower Defense, Roguelike, Strategy  
Platform: PC

Story and Lore  
Mages in the capital spot a crystal falling from another planet. After several investigations, they realize that the crystal is emitting very high energy, and therefore the dead from the surrounding cemetery are resurrecting and attacking people. Therefore, they assign a guardian to conduct experiments on the crystal, eliminate this disaster, and deliver it safely to the capital. While the guardian was taking the crystal to the capital, the dead he encountered wanted to take the crystal from him. If the crystal falls into the hands of the dead, the dead will rule the world cause of the high energy it emits. The guardian fights on this path at the expense of his life and tries to get rid of the dead.

Game Concept  
•	A crystal from another planet resurrects the dead for a sinister purpose. To prevent this and examine the crystal, the Guardian’s mission is to take it to the capital before the dead take possession of it.  
•	The Guardian must protect the crystal from waves of enemies to prevent theft using the crystal’s energy.  
•	If the crystal is stolen or the Guardian dies, the manager automatically rewinds time for another attempt.
